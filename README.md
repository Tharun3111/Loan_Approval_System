# Loan_Approval_System
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting loan eligibility for potential borrowers. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist in automating the loan approval process, helping financial institutions make more accurate and efficient decisions.


## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting loan eligibility for potential borrowers. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist in automating the loan approval process, helping financial institutions make more accurate and efficient decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the predictive model is not included in this repository due to privacy and licensing restrictions. However, the code assumes that the dataset is available in a CSV format with the following features:

- `ApplicantIncome`: Income of the applicant (numeric).
- `CoapplicantIncome`: Income of the co-applicant (numeric).    
- `LoanAmount`: The loan amount requested (numeric).
- `LoanTerm`: Term of the loan in months (numeric).
- `CreditHistory`: Credit history of the applicant (categorical: 0 or 1).
- `Gender`: Gender of the applicant (categorical: Male or Female).
- `Married`: Marital status of the applicant (categorical: Yes or No).
- `Dependents`: Number of dependents (numeric).
- `Education`: Education level of the applicant (categorical: Graduate or Not Graduate).
- `SelfEmployed`: Self-employment status of the applicant (categorical: Yes or No).
- `PropertyArea`: Type of property area (categorical: Urban, Semiurban, or Rural).
- `Loan_Status`: Loan eligibility (categorical: Y or N).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

  
## Model Selection
For this project, we have chosen a classification model to predict loan eligibility based on historical data. The model is trained on the provided dataset and evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is assessed using the following evaluation metrics:

- Accuracy: Overall classification accuracy of the model.
- Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions over all positive predictions.
- Recall: Proportion of true positive predictions over all actual positive instances.
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a loan eligibility prediction model using machine learning. The developed model can be further refined and deployed in real-world financial applications to support loan approval decisions.
